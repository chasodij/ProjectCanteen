<h2> ProjectCanteen üçΩ </h2>

This is a project for the digitalization of school canteens, which allows parents to order food for their children (taking into account their dietary restrictions), canteen staff to create menus, and children to receive orders using RFID or NFC tags.

This repository is the backend (ASP.NET Core Web API) part of the project, i.e. the only part that is almost finished, so far.
